/**
 * Per-site history store.
 *
 * Persists a rolling window of raw `HistoryPoint`s (capped at
 * `maxHistoryPoints`) plus one `DailyRollup` per UTC day for long-range graphs.
 * Also derives the aggregate stats the summary needs: uptime ratios over
 * 24h/7d/30d/90d windows, average response time over 24h, and a compact
 * ~45-bucket sparkline.
 *
 * Uptime math: each point contributes its STATUS_WEIGHT (up=1, degraded=0.5,
 * down=0). The window ratio is the mean weight of points whose timestamp falls
 * inside the window. For windows longer than the raw retention, we fall back to
 * the daily rollups so long-range numbers survive point pruning.
